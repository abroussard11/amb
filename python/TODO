TODO list:

 1. Test the .zyp file make commands
    Put in logic to convert make_db [the directory] to make-db [the exe]

 2. Finish the make_db package: a package that parses and pretty prints
    the output from 'make -np'

 3. Clean up the pyLauncher implementation

 4. Implement the Build Dependency Graph Tool
    Rename it to something better: graph-tool, dep-anal, build-analyze
    Implement header_locator
